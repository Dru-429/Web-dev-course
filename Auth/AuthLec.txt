Lesson 1 : 
    
Authentication : Prove Who you are

1. It means to prove who are we like showing id card at the enterance gate. 

2. In code form client side we send 
        {
            "email": "adbc",
            "password": "1234",
        }
    and then we check the credential using middelware and if correct backend response with :
        {
           "accessToken": "xyz.abc.123",
            "user": {
                "name": "Dru",
                "role": "admin" 
            },
        }

Authorization : What yor are allowed to do

1. Here we check the role of the user and what he is allowed to do so 
2. in code      
    if (user.role === 'admin') {
  // allow deleting a user
}
